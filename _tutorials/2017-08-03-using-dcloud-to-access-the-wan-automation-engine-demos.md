# Overview

The WAN Automation Engine (WAE) is a software platform that provides multivendor and multilayer visibility and analysis for service provider and large enterprise networks. It plays a critical role in answering key questions of network resource availability by simulating an abstracted model of the network, and when appropriate can automate and simplify Traffic Engineering mechanisms such as RSVP-TE and Segment Routing.

Here on XR Docs, we are aiming to provide tutorials, blogs and other technical resources in order to help customers and partners understand how to effectively use WAE. Given that WAE is a product that requires a license, these tutorials will be using Cisco dCloud which provides a private demo environment.

This tutorial will show you how to launch a WAE demo on dCloud. 

**Note:** There are several WAE demos on dCloud, the tutorial will tell you which demo to launch and what plan file to use.
