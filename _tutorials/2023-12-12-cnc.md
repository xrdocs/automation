# Introduction

Service Provider networks inherently span vast and diverse landscapes. These networks often involve intricate blends of hardware and software solutions, often sourced from various vendors. While these ecosystems offer advantages, the task of aligning one vendor's tools to effectively manage changes on another vendor's hardware continues to present a formidable challenge.  

Cisco's Crosswork Controller serves as one of these network orchestration tools. It's essential to understand the range of supported use cases to fully appreciate its capabilities and limitations. The supported use cases can be checked on cisco.com [Solution Overview](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/cloud-systems-management/crosswork-network-controller/5-0/Solution-Workflow-Guide/bk-crosswork-network-controller-5-0-solution-workflow-guide/m-solution-overview.html#Cisco_Generic_Topic.dita_e1b66704-bf56-4676-8c0b-f956b30bc05f) page.
